Python Variables
================

### Creating Variables:

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the
ability to manipulate variables. A variable is a name that refers to a
value. An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them
values.Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for
declaring a variable.A variable is created the moment you first assign a
value to it.For example

```python
        x = 10
        y = "Laxmi"
        print(x)
```

    10

```python
        print(y)
```

    Laxmi

As shown in example, the variable x holds the value 10 and y holds the
word “Laxmi”.

Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can
even change type after they have been set.

```python
        x = 4 # x is of type int
        print(x)
```

    4

```python
    x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
    print(x)
```

    Sally

As we see in the previos example, initially the x was as interger type
but afterwards changed to String type.

### Variabe Name

Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are
meaningful and document what the variable is used for.A variable can
have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age,
carname, total\_volume). Rules for Python variables are as below:

-   1.  A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore
        character

-   1.  A variable name cannot start with a number  

-   1.  A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and
        underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ )  

-   1.  Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three
        different variables)  

-   1.  Python keywords cannot be used as variable.

Always remember that the variables are case sensitive.

### Variable Type

The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person’s
age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as
alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are
used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method
for each of them.

Python has five standard data types.These are listed as below:

-   1.  Numbers  

-   1.  String  

-   1.  List  

-   1.  Tuple  

-   1.  Dictionary
