# Python - Introduction
--------------------

### What is Python?
===============

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach
to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic
typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language
for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most
platforms.Python is a popular programming language. It was created in
1991 by Guido van Rossum.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the
Python Web site, <https://www.python.org/>, and may be freely
distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers
to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and
additional documentation.

This tutorial introduces the reader to the basic concepts and features
of the Python language and installation of python in different operating
systems.Python is used in following ways:

    a)web development (server-side),
    b)software development,
    c)mathematics,
    d)system scripting and more...

### What can Python do?
===================

Python can be useful in following ways:  
a)Python can be used on a server to create web applications.  
b)Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.  
c)Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify
files.  
d)Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex
mathematics.  
e)Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready
software development.

### Why Python?
===========

Python is one of the popular programmig language becuse of the following
reasons:

a)Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry
Pi, etc).  
b)Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.  
c)Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer
lines than some other programming languages.  
d)Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be
executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be
very quick.  
e)Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-orientated way or
a functional way.

### Python- Installation
--------------------

Your programming environment is the computer you do your work on, and
all the software that’s installed on your system which helps you write
and run programs. Some systems are better for programming than others,
but the best system to learn on is probably the one you are using right
now. This section will help you get your system set up so you can start
writing programs quickly.  
Our goal is to help you get Python up and running on your computer, so
that you can write and run your own programs. To do this, we want to:

1.  Find out if Python is already installed on your computer.  
2.  Install Python, if it is not already installed.  
3.  Install a text editor that will make it easy to run your first
    programs.  
4.  Help you enter and run Hello World, your first Python program.

##### Mac
---

If you go to a Python conference or meetup, you’re likely to see more
Macbooks than any other computer. So Macs are certainly a good platform
on which to learn Python. Many of the people you see using Macbooks are
actually running some distribution of Linux on their Mac, and running
Python within a virtual Linux machine. You don’t have to worry about
that yet, just know that if you continue to grow as a programmer your
Mac will probably continue to serve you quite well.

Python 2.7 is probably already installed on your Mac, so we’ll just
verify that it is installed, and then install Sublime Text. If you want
to start with Python 3, we’ll walk you through setting up Python 3 on
your system as well.

Python is probably already installed on your system. To find out if it
is installed, open a terminal and type the word python. To open a
terminal, go to Applications and look for Terminal, or enter ‘terminal’
in your system’s search bar.

```
sys$version
```

    [1] "2.7.10 (default, Oct  6 2017, 22:29:07) \n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 9.0.0 (clang-900.0.31)]"

```python
    print("Hello Python world!")
```

    Hello Python world!

From this output, we can see that Python is installed, and the currently
installed version is Python 2.7.10. You’re now running a Python terminal
session. You can start typing Python commands here, and you’ll see your
output immediately:

##### Windows
-------

Python doesn’t come pre-installed on most Windows computers, but you can
download an installer that will set Python up for you. Once you have
Python installed and running, it’s pretty straightforward to install
other text editor, and then configure it to run Python programs.Please
follow the links for tutorial for installaton information
