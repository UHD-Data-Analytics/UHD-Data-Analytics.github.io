Installing Julia
================

Julia is a high - level general - purpose programming language that was

compilation. It is currently supported by Linux, macOS, Windows, and
community support for FreeBSD.

To install Julia:

1. Go to <https://julialang.org/downloads/>
2. Click on the version recommended for your system.
3. Follow installation instructions from the downloaded file.
